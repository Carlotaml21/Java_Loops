# Multiplication Table Generator (TDD)

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a program that generates the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) for a given integer `n`. The implementation follows the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## 📝 Requirements

- The program should receive an integer `n` and return its multiplication table.
- The output should be formatted as follows:

  **Example (for n = 5):**
  ```
  5 x 1 = 5
  5 x 2 = 10
  5 x 3 = 15
  5 x 4 = 20
  5 x 5 = 25
  5 x 6 = 30
  5 x 7 = 35
  5 x 8 = 40
  5 x 9 = 45
  5 x 10 = 50
  ```
- The function must be tested using **TDD**, ensuring at least **70% code coverage**.
